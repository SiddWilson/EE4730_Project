# EE4730_Project
Group Project for EE4730 - 3D Modeling.

The purpose of this application is to capture input from monocular source, perform pose estimation, and then apply the pose to a skeleton for animation.


--- Pose Estimation ---
This project will use OpenPose, an open sourced library, for pose estimation purposes. The repo can be found here: https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose
